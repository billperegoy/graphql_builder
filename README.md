This package allows creation of a GraphQL query or mutation string to be created
from an Elixir structure.

This allows a more "correct by construction" string versus manually creating
the string by hand. This is currently a very minimal package only intended to
make it easier to generate query strings to be used in Elixir unit tests. The
idea for this package was taken from the
[gql-query-builder](https://github.com/atulmy/gql-query-builder) package
written for node development.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `:graphql_builder` to your list of
dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:graphql_builder, "~> 0.3.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

Here are some usage examples:

### Simple Query

```elixir
iex> query = %Query{operation: :thoughts, fields: [:id, :name, :thought]}

iex>  GraphqlBuilder.query(query)
query {
  thoughts {
    id,
    name,
    thought
  }
}

```

### Simple Query with Variables

```elixir
iex> query = %Query{
...>   operation: :thoughts,
...>   fields: [:name, :thought],
...>   variables: [id: 12]
...> }

iex> GraphqlBuilder.query(query)
query {
  thoughts(id: 12) {
    name,
    thought
  }
}

```

### Query with Nested Fields

```elixir
iex> query = %Query{
...>   operation: :orders,
...>   fields: [:id, :amount, user: [:id, :name, :email, address: [:city, :country]]]
...> }

iex> GraphqlBuilder.query(query)
query {
  orders {
    id,
    amount,
    user {
      id,
      name,
      email,
      address {
        city,
        country
      }
    }
  }
}

```

### Fragment in-line support

In version 0.3.2 the library only supports inline fragments and does not yet support previously defined fragments.

To define an inline fragment you can do it as follows:

```elixir
iex> query = %GraphqlBuilder.Query{
...>   operation: :orders,
...>   fields: [:id, {:on, "User", [:username]}]
...> }

iex> GraphqlBuilder.query(query)
query {
  orders {
    id,
    ... on WpUser {
      username
    }
  }
}

```

### Simple Mutation

```elixir
iex> query = %Query{
...>  operation: :thought_create,
...>  variables: [
...>    name: "Tyrion Lannister'",
...>    thought: "I drink and I know things."
...>  ],
...>  fields: [:id]
...>}

iex> GraphqlBuilder.mutation(query)
mutation {
  thought_create(name: "Tyrion Lannister'", thought: "I drink and I know things.") {
    id
  }
}

```

### Mutation With Nested Params

```elixir
iex> query = %Query{
...>   operation: :update_breed,
...>   variables: [
...>     id: 12,
...>     params: [label: "label", abbreviation: "abbreviation"]
...>   ],
...>   fields: [:label, :abbreviation]
...> }

iex> GraphqlBuilder.mutation(query)
mutation {
  update_breed(id: 12, params: {label: "label", abbreviation: "abbreviation"}) {
    label,
    abbreviation
  }
}

```
